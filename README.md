## My process

### Built with

- HTML5 markup
- SCSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

Throughout my learning journey, I have gained a deeper understanding of React and its capabilities. Specifically, I learned how to use the Context Hook, which has enabled me to streamline the process of passing data between components.

In addition, I developed skills in creating a filter application, which allows users to easily search and find specific data. Integrating dark mode was another valuable skill that I acquired, as it improves the user experience by providing a choice between a light or dark interface.

Finally, creating modals has enhanced my ability to design and develop more intuitive interfaces, allowing me to display additional information or prompts to users in a non-intrusive manner. Overall, these new skills have allowed me to create more sophisticated and engaging web applications in React.
